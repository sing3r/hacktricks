## .dtors

{% hint style="danger" %}
Nowadays is very **weird to find a binary with a .dtors section!**
{% endhint %}

The destructors are functions that are **executed before program finishes** (after the `main` function returns).\
The addresses to these functions are stored inside the **`.dtors`** section of the binary and therefore, if you manage to **write** the **address** to a **shellcode** in **`__DTOR_END__`** , that will be **executed** before the programs ends.

Get the address of this section with:

```bash
objdump -s -j .dtors /exec
rabin -s /exec | grep ‚Äú__DTOR‚Äù
```

Usually you will find the **DTOR** markers **between** the values `ffffffff` and `00000000`. So if you just see those values, it means that there **isn't any function registered**. So **overwrite** the **`00000000`** with the **address** to the **shellcode** to execute it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ofc, you first need to find a **place to store the shellcode** in order to later call it.
{% endhint %}

## **.fini\_array**

Essentially this is a structure with **functions that will be called** before the program finishes, like **`.dtors`**. This is interesting if you can call your **shellcode just jumping to an address**, or in cases where you need to go **back to `main`** again to **exploit the vulnerability a second time**.

```bash
objdump -s -j .fini_array ./greeting

./greeting:     file format elf32-i386

Contents of section .fini_array:
 8049934 a0850408

#Put your address in 0x8049934
```

Note that when a function from the **`.fini_array`** is executed it moves to the next one, so it won't be executed several time (preventing eternal loops), but also it'll only give you 1 **execution of the function** placed here.

Note that entries in `.fini_array` are called in **reverse** order, so you probably wants to start writing from the last one.

#### Eternal loop

In order to abuse **`.fini_array`** to get an eternal loop you can [**check what was done here**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack\_pivot/insomnihack18\_onewrite/index.html)**:** If you have at least 2 entries in **`.fini_array`**, you can:

* Use your first write to **call the vulnerable arbitrary write function** again
* Then, calculate the return address in the stack stored by **`__libc_csu_fini`** (the function that it calling all the `.fini_array` functions) and put there the **address of `__libc_csu_fini`**
  * This will make **`__libc_csu_fini`** call himself again executing the **`.fini_array`** functions again which will call the vulnerable WWW function 2 times: one for **arbitrary write** and another one to overwrite again the **return address of `__libc_csu_fini`** on the stack to call itself again.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that with [**Full RELRO**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/relro.md)**,** the section **`.fini_array`** is made **read-only**.
{% endhint %}

## link\_map

As explained [**in this post**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#2---targetting-ldso-link\_map-structure), If the program exist using `return` or `exit()` it'll run `__run_exit_handlers()` which will call registered destructors.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the program exits via **`_exit()`** function, it'll call the **`exit` syscall** and the exit handlers will not be executed. So, to confirm `__run_exit_handlers()` is executed you can set a breakpoint on it.
{% endhint %}

The important code is ([source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.32/source/elf/dl-fini.c#L131)):

```c
ElfW(Dyn) *fini_array = map->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAY];
if (fini_array != NULL)
  {
    ElfW(Addr) *array = (ElfW(Addr) *) (map->l_addr + fini_array->d_un.d_ptr);
    size_t sz = (map->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ]->d_un.d_val / sizeof (ElfW(Addr)));

    while (sz-- > 0)
      ((fini_t) array[sz]) ();
  }
  [...]




// This is the d_un structure
ptype l->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAY]->d_un
type = union {
    Elf64_Xword d_val;	// address of function that will be called, we put our onegadget here
    Elf64_Addr d_ptr;	// offset from l->l_addr of our structure
}
```

Note how `map -> l_addr + fini_array -> d_un.d_ptr` is used to **calculate** the position of the **array of functions to call**.

There are a **couple of options**:

* Overwrite the value of `map->l_addr` to make it point to a **fake `fini_array`** with instructions to execute arbitrary code
* Overwrite `l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAY]` and `l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ]` entries (which are more or less consecutive in memory) , to make them **points to a forged `Elf64_Dyn`** structure that will make again **`array` points to a memory** zone the attacker controlled.&#x20;
  * [**This writeup**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/write-ups/tree/main/DanteCTF.2023/pwn/Sentence.To.Hell) overwrites `l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAY]` with the address of a controlled memory in `.bss` containing a fake `fini_array`. This fake array contains **first a** [**one gadget**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/one-gadget.md) **address** which will be executed and then the **difference** between in the address of this **fake array** and the v**alue of `map->l_addr`** so `*array` will point to the fake array.
  * According to main post of this technique and [**this writeup**](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/csc/writeups/angstromctf-2021-wallstreet) ld.so leave a pointer on the stack that points to the binary `link_map` in ld.so. With an arbitrary write it's possible to overwrite it and make it point to a fake `fini_array` controlled by the attacker with the address to a [**one gadget**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/one-gadget.md) for example.

Following the previous code you can find another interesting section with the code:

```c
/* Next try the old-style destructor.  */
ElfW(Dyn) *fini = map->l_info[DT_FINI];
if (fini != NULL)
  DL_CALL_DT_FINI (map, ((void *) map->l_addr + fini->d_un.d_ptr));
}
```

In this case it would be possible to overwrite the value of `map->l_info[DT_FINI]` pointing to a forged `ElfW(Dyn)` structure. Find [**more information here**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#2---targetting-ldso-link\_map-structure).

## TLS-Storage dtor\_list overwrite in **`__run_exit_handlers`**

As [**explained here**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#5---code-execution-via-tls-storage-dtor\_list-overwrite), if a program exits via `return` or `exit()`, it'll execute **`__run_exit_handlers()`** which will call any destructors function registered.

Code from `_run_exit_handlers()`:

```c
/* Call all functions registered with `atexit' and `on_exit',
   in the reverse of the order in which they were registered
   perform stdio cleanup, and terminate program execution with STATUS.  */
void
attribute_hidden
__run_exit_handlers (int status, struct exit_function_list **listp,
                     bool run_list_atexit, bool run_dtors)
{
  /* First, call the TLS destructors.  */
#ifndef SHARED
  if (&__call_tls_dtors != NULL)
#endif
    if (run_dtors)
      __call_tls_dtors ();
```

Code from **`__call_tls_dtors()`**:

```c
typedef void (*dtor_func) (void *);
struct dtor_list //struct added
{
  dtor_func func;
  void *obj;
  struct link_map *map;
  struct dtor_list *next;
};

[...]
/* Call the destructors.  This is called either when a thread returns from the
   initial function or when the process exits via the exit function.  */
void
__call_tls_dtors (void)
{
  while (tls_dtor_list)		// parse the dtor_list chained structures
    {
      struct dtor_list *cur = tls_dtor_list;		// cur point to tls-storage dtor_list
      dtor_func func = cur->func;
      PTR_DEMANGLE (func);						// demangle the function ptr

      tls_dtor_list = tls_dtor_list->next;		// next dtor_list structure
      func (cur->obj);					
      [...]
    }
}
```

For each registered function in **`tls_dtor_list`**, it'll demangle the pointer from **`cur->func`** and call it with the argument **`cur->obj`**.

Using the **`tls`** function from this [**fork of GEF**](https://github.com/bata24/gef), it's possible to see that actually the **`dtor_list`** is very **close** to the **stack canary** and **PTR\_MANGLE cookie**. So, with an overflow on it's it would be possible to **overwrite** the **cookie** and the **stack canary**.\
Overwriting the PTR\_MANGLE cookie, it would be possible to **bypass the `PTR_DEMANLE` function** as setting it to 0x00, will mean that the **`xor`** used to get the real address is just the address configured. Then, writing on the **`dtor_list`** it's possible **chain several functions** with the function **address** and it's **argument.**

Finally notice that the stored pointer is not only going to be xored with the cookie but also rotated 17 bits:

```armasm
0x00007fc390444dd4 <+36>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbx]      --> mangled ptr
0x00007fc390444dd7 <+39>:	ror    rax,0x11		        --> rotate of 17 bits
0x00007fc390444ddb <+43>:	xor    rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x30	--> xor with PTR_MANGLE
```

So you need to take this into account before adding a new address.

Find an example in the [**original post**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#5---code-execution-via-tls-storage-dtor\_list-overwrite).

## Other mangled pointers in **`__run_exit_handlers`**

This technique is [**explained here**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#5---code-execution-via-tls-storage-dtor\_list-overwrite) and depends again on the program **exiting calling `return` or `exit()`** so **`__run_exit_handlers()`** is called.

Let's check more code of this function:



```c
  while (true)
    {
      struct exit_function_list *cur;

    restart:
      cur = *listp;

      if (cur == NULL)
	{
	  /* Exit processing complete.  We will not allow any more
	     atexit/on_exit registrations.  */
	  __exit_funcs_done = true;
	  break;
	}

      while (cur->idx > 0)
	{
	  struct exit_function *const f = &cur->fns[--cur->idx];
	  const uint64_t new_exitfn_called = __new_exitfn_called;

	  switch (f->flavor)
	    {
	      void (*atfct) (void);
	      void (*onfct) (int status, void *arg);
	      void (*cxafct) (void *arg, int status);
	      void *arg;

	    case ef_free:
	    case ef_us:
	      break;
	    case ef_on:
	      onfct = f->func.on.fn;
	      arg = f->func.on.arg;
	      PTR_DEMANGLE (onfct);

	      /* Unlock the list while we call a foreign function.  */
	      __libc_lock_unlock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      onfct (status, arg);
	      __libc_lock_lock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      break;
	    case ef_at:
	      atfct = f->func.at;
	      PTR_DEMANGLE (atfct);

	      /* Unlock the list while we call a foreign function.  */
	      __libc_lock_unlock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      atfct ();
	      __libc_lock_lock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      break;
	    case ef_cxa:
	      /* To avoid dlclose/exit race calling cxafct twice (BZ 22180),
		 we must mark this function as ef_free.  */
	      f->flavor = ef_free;
	      cxafct = f->func.cxa.fn;
	      arg = f->func.cxa.arg;
	      PTR_DEMANGLE (cxafct);

	      /* Unlock the list while we call a foreign function.  */
	      __libc_lock_unlock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      cxafct (arg, status);
	      __libc_lock_lock (__exit_funcs_lock);
	      break;
	    }

	  if (__glibc_unlikely (new_exitfn_called != __new_exitfn_called))
	    /* The last exit function, or another thread, has registered
	       more exit functions.  Start the loop over.  */
	    goto restart;
	}

      *listp = cur->next;
      if (*listp != NULL)
	/* Don't free the last element in the chain, this is the statically
	   allocate element.  */
	free (cur);
    }

  __libc_lock_unlock (__exit_funcs_lock);
```

The variable `f` points to the **`initial`** structure and depending on the value of `f->flavor` different functions will be called.\
Depending on the value, the address of the function to call will be in a different place, but it'll always be **demangled**.

Moreover, in the options **`ef_on`** and **`ef_cxa`** it's also possible to control an **argument**.

It's possible to check the **`initial` structure** in a debugging session with GEF running **`gef> p initial`**.

To abuse this you need either to **leak or erase the `PTR_MANGLE`cookie** and then overwrite a `cxa` entry in initial with `system('/bin/sh')`.\
You can find an example of this in the [**original blog post about the technique**](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md#6---code-execution-via-other-mangled-pointers-in-initial-structure).
