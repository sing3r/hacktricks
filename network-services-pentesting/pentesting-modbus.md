**Instantly available setup for vulnerability assessment & penetration testing**. Run a full pentest from anywhere with 20+ tools & features that go from recon to reporting. We don't replace pentesters - we develop custom tools, detection & exploitation modules to give them back some time to dig deeper, pop shells, and have fun.

# Basic Information

In 1979, the **Modbus Protocol** was developed by Modicon, serving as a messaging structure. Its primary use involves facilitating communication between intelligent devices, operating under a master-slave/client-server model. This protocol plays a crucial role in enabling devices to exchange data efficiently.

**Default port:** 502

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
502/tcp open  modbus
```

# Enumeration

```bash
nmap --script modbus-discover -p 502 <IP>
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbusdetect
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbus_findunitid
```
