<figure><img src="/.gitbook/assets/pentest-tools.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Instantly available setup for vulnerability assessment & penetration testing**. Run a full pentest from anywhere with 20+ tools & features that go from recon to reporting. We don't replace pentesters - we develop custom tools, detection & exploitation modules to give them back some time to dig deeper, pop shells, and have fun.
