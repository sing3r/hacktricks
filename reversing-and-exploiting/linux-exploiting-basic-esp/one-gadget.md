# One Gadget


## Basic Information

[**One Gadget**](https://github.com/david942j/one\_gadget) allows to obtain a shell instead of using **system** and **"/bin/sh". One Gadget** will find inside the libc library some way to obtain a shell (`execve("/bin/sh")`) using just one **address**.\
However, normally there are some constrains, the most common ones and easy to avoid are like `[rsp+0x30] == NULL` As you control the values inside the **RSP** you just have to send some more NULL values so the constrain is avoided.

```python
ONE_GADGET = libc.address + 0x4526a
rop2 = base + p64(ONE_GADGET) + "\x00"*100
```

To the address indicated by One Gadget you need to **add the base address where `libc`** is loaded.
