## Basic Information

This technique exploits the ability to manipulate the **Base Pointer (EBP)** to chain the execution of multiple functions through careful use of the EBP register and the `leave; ret` instruction sequence.

As a reminder, **`leave`** basically means:

```
movl               %ebp, %esp
popl               %ebp
ret
```

And as the **EBP is in the stack** before the EIP it's possible to control it controlling the stack.

### EBP2Ret

This technique is particularly useful when you can **alter the EBP register but have no direct way to change the EIP register**. It leverages the behaviour of functions when they finish executing.

If, during `fvuln`'s execution, you manage to inject a **fake EBP** in the stack that points to an area in memory where your shellcode's address is located (plus 4 bytes to account for the `pop` operation), you can indirectly control the EIP. As `fvuln` returns, the ESP is set to this crafted location, and the subsequent `pop` operation decreases ESP by 4, effectively making it point to your shellcode. When the `ret` instruction is executed, control is transferred to your shellcode.

#### Exploit Construction

First you need to **inject your shellcode** somewhere in an executable memory and **get the address**, or get the address to a valid [**ONE\_GADGET**](https://github.com/david942j/one\_gadget), or make the ESP point to a place with the address of **`system()`** followed by **4 junk bytes** and the address of `"/bin/sh"`.

Then, create a padding and **compromise the EBP** with the `address to the shellcode/one_gadget - 4`. It must be `-4` because of the `pop`. Then, the `ESP` will be pointing to our desired address and and the `ret` will be executed.

#### Off-By-One Exploit

There's a specific variant of this technique known as an "Off-By-One Exploit". It's used when you can **only modify the least significant byte of the EBP**. In such a case, the memory location storing the shellcode's address must share the first three bytes with the EBP, allowing for a similar manipulation with more constrained conditions.

### **EBP Chaining**

Therefore, putting a controlled address in the `EBP` entry of the stack and an address to `leave; ret` in `EIP`, it's possible to **move the `ESP` to the controlled `EBP` address from the stack**.

Now, the **`ESP`** is controlled pointing to a desired address and the next instruction to execute is a `RET`. To abuse this, it's possible to place in the controlled ESP place this:

* **`&(next fake EBP)`** -> Load the new EBP because of `pop ebp` from the `leave` instruction
* **`system()`** -> Called by `ret`
* **`&(leave;ret)`** -> Called after system ends, it will move ESP to the fake EBP and start agin
* **`&("/bin/sh")`**-> Param fro `system`

Basically this way it's possible to chain several fake EBPs to control the flow of the program.

Tbh, this is like a [ret2lib](ret2lib/), but more complex with no apparent benefit but could be interesting in some edge-cases.
