In situations where an application is restricted to certain countries, and you're unable to install it on your Android device due to regional limitations, spoofing your location to a country where the app is available can grant you access. The steps below detail how to do this:

1. **Install Hotspot Shield Free VPN Proxy:**
   - Begin by downloading and installing the Hotspot Shield Free VPN Proxy from the Google Play Store.

2. **Connect to a VPN Server:**
   - Open the Hotspot Shield application.
   - Connect to a VPN server by selecting the country where the application you want to access is available.

3. **Clear Google Play Store Data:**
   - Navigate to your device's **Settings**.
   - Proceed to **Apps** or **Application Manager** (this may differ depending on your device).
   - Find and select **Google Play Store** from the list of apps.
   - Tap on **Force Stop** to terminate any running processes of the app.
   - Then tap on **Clear Data** or **Clear Storage** (the exact wording may vary) to reset the Google Play Store app to its default state.

4. **Access the Restricted Application:**
   - Open the **Google Play Store**.
   - The store should now reflect the content of the country you connected to via the VPN.
   - You should be able to search for and install the application that was previously unavailable in your actual location.

### Important Notes:
- The effectiveness of this method can vary based on several factors including the VPN service's reliability and the specific regional restrictions imposed by the app.
- Regularly using a VPN may affect the performance of some apps and services.
- Be aware of the terms of service for any app or service you're using, as using a VPN to bypass regional restrictions may violate those terms.
